		<font size="5"><p>Blotbot is a robot that helps the blind live their everyday life easier. Even though there are service dogs to help you, dogs are very hard to take care because you have to potty train them, feed them, and entertain them. This robot only needs to charge overnight for a full day exprience. Blotbot will sense when it is at low battery and move toward it's charging station and be at your service in the morning. It has four cameras, 4 wheels, 2 speakers, a braile keyboard, a human leash, and a blot which is an intelligent assistant that helps you and guides you to wherever you want to go!</p>
